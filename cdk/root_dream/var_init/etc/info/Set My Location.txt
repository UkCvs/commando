SET MY LOCATION for DM500S Commando 16.0 - LraiZer & AL - 20 October 2016
=========================================================================

WHAT IS IT?  It's for UK and ROI users on Astra 28.2E to quickly and easily set their 
correct regional channels and related GetEPG / RT-EPG mapping, totally automatically.

WHERE IS IT? BLUE > BLUE > GREEN >RED
SML has undergone two major overhauls since C14.6 - firstly, a far more user-friendly,
easy to navigate and intuitive GUI menu..

Secondly, and thanks to Abu Baniaz, the regional ITV and ITV+1 channel names are 
back! With picon symlinks re-instated for your local ITV and ITV+1 too, woo!

SML allocates the correct Area and Region codes for your local regional channels and
this data is then read by AutoBouquets each time it runs

HOW DOES IT WORK? First choose your region- England, Scotland, Wales, NI, or ROI. Users
in the latter three regions are then finished after just one key press! Some users in
England and Scotland will then be asked to choose their regional ITV name and whoosh- 
they are now done with only two key presses!

The majority of users in England will finally be asked for their preferred BBC1 channel,
so that's a maximum of 3 key presses and a few seconds well-spent! It autosaves all the 
new settings, with a new (in Commando 15) popup confirmation 'Saved' message.

Behind the scenes, LraiZer has really done us proud. Without you realizing it, he also
sets your correct local ITV1 +1, Channel 4, Channel 4 +1, Channel 5 and Channel 5 +1 
services, as well as the correct GetEPG and RT-EPG mapping for all these channels!

Finally, users who selected Republic of Ireland not only get their RTE One, RTE Two and
TV3 channels, but the TG4 and 3e channels in slots 1 to 5, followd by N Ireland BBC1, 
BBC2 and UTV ones too! Not to mention a load of UK FTA channels following on behind,
(with ££ not Euros in the adverts. And we thought it was Rip-Off Britain...

So you can now proceed to AutoBouqets, which will build a brand-new and up to date 
set of Bouquets for you specific to YOUR exact location. 

See the 02-AutoBouquets.txt helpfile for further details on this...
