AutoBouquets N1 for C15.0 - by LraiZer - 29 Jan 2014 (updated 10 Mar 2016)
==========================================================================

WHAT'S NEW? LraiZer has created a new 'autobouquetsreader' binary (or daemon, as these
executable files are referred to in Linux). This is super-fast and reads the current
NIT, BAT, and SDT data directly from the 28.2E stream.

So no more five minute Service scan, and no more issues when certain transponders are
temporarily shut down! His binary is also half the size of dvbsnoop, previously used
for finding stream EPG IDs, freeing-up useful space in the SquashFS root partition.

When the new AutoBouquets is running, you can carry on watching telly normally. It
will create a new set of services and bouquets in exact accordance with your custom
settings (more on this below) AND autogenerate a new and bang-up-to-date GetEPG map.
All in an astonishing 45 to 55 seconds!!! 

After two months of intensive beta-testing, we have had no problems at all with it!
Such a major leap forward is what made TC decide to release this terrific work in a
brand new image release and do it justice. We have also designed a new AutoBouquets
Wizard GUI menu (nice and intuitive and user-friendly) in order to encompass all of
the new features and user options LraiZer has included for us in AutoBouquets N1.

WHERE IS IT?  
The Autobouquets Wizard is in the BLUE button 'Commando Toolbox' menu. Hit [2] to run
the "AutoBouquets NOW" plugin, or move on with a BLUE > GREEN to browse through all
the AutoBouquets Wizard menu options we've provided for you in the new 30 Jan 2014 
Commando 15.0 release! 

Autobouquets navigation Options from this point on are as follows:

28.2E Area / Region: default is London (as determined by BSkyB)
change location with RED (for the user-friendly 28.2E Set My Location menu)
changes overwrite /var/etc/sml.dat

Custom sort default = 1 (or 2) all +1 channels are below their parent
change this in GREEN > YELLOW menu:
GREEN = 3 (or 4)= all +1 channels (except movies) in their own bouquet
YELLOW = 5 = stream ordering initially, user may change sort order
The custom_sort_n.txt files are in the /var/etc folder, where 'n' is the
number above. 1 and 3 are UK, while 2 and 4 are specially for ROI users
========
# 0 - 28.2E stream order, 1 and up (coded fallback if custom sort files lost)
# 1 - radiotimes, +1 channels follow parents (default), 1 and up
# 2 - same as above, but for users in the Republic of Ireland
# 3 - all +1 channels (except movies) in own bouquet, 1 and up
# 4 - same as above, but for users in the Republic of Ireland
# 5 - 28.2E stream order, then user defineable sorting, 1 and up
#	- (or 1001 and up in all cases if bskyb bouquet option is active)
========

Parental Control = 1 (all adult and gambling services are totally nuked.
Commando is a child-friendly image by default!!! 
User can opt in to load adult content with GREEN > GREEN > RED

FTA channels only =0 (OFF / NO)
change with GREEN > GREEN > YELLOW if you want free to air services only

Sky bouquet.= 0 (OFF / NO) - change to 1 = ON / YES create this bouquet:
GREEN > RED > RED

This bouquet replicates Sky channel numbering from 101 to 999 including
empty placeholders, for those users who run a sky box in the house and
are used to the numbers for their favourite channels.

With this option active, the normal bouquets will start 1001 and upwards
from BBC1 in 'Entertainment'.

#########################################

Run Autobouquets: via the Plugin- BLUE > 2 (can also be set as a daily Timer)
or from BLUE > BLUE > GREEN > YELLOW AutoBouquets Wizard
or telnet command: autobouquets

=============================================

*****  NEW for the C15.0c update of 30 April 2014  *****

This has taken us a couple of months to accomplish, coz LraiZer has gone AWOL again!
Never mind, 'impossible' is NOT a word in TC's vocabulary, so when we get a bright
idea or three, we aim to see them through, without blitzing the existing user setup
in your current C15.0 or C15.0b image! It's quite a radical transformation...

1. The AutoBouquets scripting has been totally recoded from a blank sheet of paper
2. NO MORE manual editing of the custom_user_x.txt files for channels ordering!
3. NO MORE manual editing of a bqx-ref file for bouquet names and ordering!
4. YOU now control all this stuff with BOUQUET EDITOR (via OSD and/or yWeb)!!!
5. The C15.0c update reads your existing channels sort order and keeps them!
6. AND your existing AutBouquets settings for parental control, Location, etc!
7. A 'My Favourites' bouquet created via the BLUE button is now preserved!
8. AutoBouquets now keeps 'multisat' bouquets AND in your preferred order too!
9. AND it keeps your 'Astra 28.2E' A-Z bouquet (if existing), in order, too!

Autobouquets N1 is now your slave, NOT your master. NOTHING is impossible, eh?

Change things how you like in Bouquet Editor, including hiding and/or locking
Bouquets, renaming them, and re-ordering them. (The new 03-Bouquet Editor.txt
helpfile explains how to work the [MENU] button toggle for the Rename > Hide >
Lock functions in the OSD Bouquet Editor). You can click any Bouquet and then
Add or Remove channels, and reshuffle the channel ordering, if you wish.

When you SAVE your changes in the Bouquet Editor, zapit tells AutoBouquets that
it has some housekeeping work to carry out the next time it runs, to mirror the
changes in the new bouquets.xml file. It will create a new custom_sort file for
you, not to mention a new bq-list reference file for it to read from!!!

And then, if you're on RT-EPG and such changes were detected from Bouquet Editor
and/or if AutoBouquets itself found changes in the channels line-up, then it will
now conditionally launch RT-EPG Auto-Mapping to update that in no time at all...

NOTE:
=====
You might have noticed that when your box restarted following the online update,
AutoBouquets kicked-in automatically a minute later and that this then put the
Bouquet names and ordering back to standard.

We're really sorry about this apparent 'control-freak' operation, but it really
was a VITAL first step to take in order to create a new bouquets.xml file, before
letting you run loose with Bouquet Editor and so on.

The newly-created bouquets.xml now contains all the unique bouquet_id reference
numbers that are the key to the ways that AutoBouquets (and RT-EPG mapping) now
functions. Before, these were all in a vanilla bouquet_id="0000" format, which
would have caused chaos if Bouquet Editor or Scan ran before AutoBouquets!

Rest assured this was just a necessary one-off task and that it won't keep on
doing this after subsequent reboots. And it was only cosmetic, wasn't it?

===========================================================================

*****  NEW in AutoBouquets for the C15.0d update of 27 October 2014  *****

Very little has been needed in the AutoBouquets engine itself, as this is now
just about as perfect as we can make it. It's all been about listening to your
feedback (and that of our trusted band of beta testers) in order to add yet
more layers of insulation, robustness and disaster recovery to this superb 
program that LraiZer created for us all...

So the objective has been to make AutoBouquets virtually bomb-proof from the
possible breakages caused by external processes, standalone Scanning mainly.
And in particular, multi-Sat scenarios.

============================================================================

Update 10 March 2016: Doh, we have neglected this helpfile a bit, haven't we?

A new feature, discovered purely by accident during ABs testing, was that if
the current channel happens to be the special radio "EPG Data" channel (as
used for GetEPG) when ABs is launched, then ABs does the job in HALF the time
compared to watching TV normally. Typically, 28 secs versus 55 secs!

So we've added this option to the ABs Menu for you as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------

It's called "AutoBouquets Fast Mode" but is OFF by default. You can switch it
ON in the BLUE > BLUE > GREEN > GREEN menu, by pressing BLUE. Give it a try?

It will allow you run ABs in the OSD at the end of a BBC program and get you
back to the same BBC channel, before the next program starts! Cool, or what?

If using ABs manually in fast mode, you'll also get to see the amazing screen
backdrop now in use for DM500S C15.1d (used in Radio Mode and GetEPG as well)

Also, and thanks to LraiZer, his autobouquetsreader binary has been updated
to support special accent characters in Channel Names, like RTÉ for example.
Previously, these appeared corrupted in the OSD, but not any more...

Enjoy! TC ;)
