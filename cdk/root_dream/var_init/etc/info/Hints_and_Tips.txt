Commando 15.0 General Hints and Tips - Jan 2014
========================================================================

Here is where we provide more information on the kind of things we see new users 
struggling with, based on feedback we read both here on UkCvs.net and on other 
Forums where our work is freely shared. 

All this info remains pertinent to the new 15.0 release. However, new features
and enhancements for 15.0 are covered in detail in the respective documents.

Language / Sprache
******************

German language: By popular request from our German freunde, we have added 
Deutsch sprache support, including all the Extra code that Commando contains. 
But please remember, we have a 4.0MB JFFS2 var partition, which leaves no room 
for the usual /var_init folder normally found in the E1 root SquashFS.

Our release is by default a 7.75MB mtd3 Flash w/o Bootloader format for the UK and 
Eire, meaning that you will not see the LANGUAGE prompt at first boot, like you may
expect to see. 

To switch Language to Deutsch: Menu > Settings > OSD > Language > deutsch

And for you UK users that find yourself in German and don't know how to get back to 
English (I did this long ago in 2004 in dBox2 Zg0re Balu from Polish, LOL!): 

Menu > 3 > 6 > Red > english

Sorry, but our Blue > Blue EPG shell menu for 28.2E is in English only. But there is
nothing stopping users from making their own translations if they wish. You'll find
all the menu conf files in the /var/tuxbox/config folder

Softcam
*******
This topic now has a new Softcams_educational.txt helpfile additional to the info
below.

Commando for DM500S is FTA, always has been, and always will be. However, we do 
carry a useful and highly intelligent Softcam Menu in the Commando Extras Menu-

BLUE > Menu > RED

Some people like to mess around with LAN Multi-Room setups, but struggle on where to 
place the added files necessary for testing and educational use. /var/bin/emu/CCcam is 
where the cam itself goes, and that is EXACTLY what it needs to be named, otherwise the
Softcam menu will not recognize it. (Linux filenames are cAsE sensitive, remember!) It 
does not need to be set to chmod 755 as the menu hard coding does this for you. You'll 
also need /var/etc/CCcam.cfg (again correctly named, as shown).

Some users wish to run oscam AND CCcam together, but need oscam to always load first, 
in order that it grabs priority over CCcam for the CardReader. Your wish is our command! 
LraiZer has tweaked Mohoush's original softcam nenu code logic so that this cam start 
order should now (in theory) be obeyed. Feedback awaited please...

For mgcamd and oscam users: ALL lib files required for testing purposes are included in
the image. Thanks to lincsat, we have also provided 'vanilla' cfg files for these cams..

Timers
******

New converts from E1 Enigma sometimes struggle to find the Timers Menu in Neutrino. 
It's dead easy really! BLUE > YELLOW! You'll find that Neutrino Timer 'Types' offer far 
more flexibility than the 3 timer types found in Enigma, because there are more of them 
at your disposal. Enter / Leave Standby, launch Plugins, reboot, for example.

Plugins
********

A major change in the 15.0 release now sees the (rather large) dvbsnoop binary replaced 
in the SquausFS root partition by LraiZer's new autobouquetsreader binary. This has
freed up valuable space in root (for libcrypto and librt). Result? More space in the var
partition, which still has over 3MB of Free Space available in our world-beating 4.0MB
JFFS2 VAR partition!

TimeZones
*********

Users in the UK and Eire can skip this section. But for our new-found friends in 
Europe, USA, Canada and even Australia, LraiZer has ported in the Timezone menu 
from NeutrinoHD so you can set your local time zone! Where is it? 

Settings > OSD > Timezone selection

The actual 72 timezones set in use are based on the E1 OpenPLi offering, so should be 
100% reliable in practice. Scroll down through the list using the OK key, and when you 
have your own timezone showing, just press the Exit key twice to go back to Settings
and then RED to Save Settings. And that's it- no restart neutrino, no reboot- it all 
works totally on the fly!!

Infobar Picons
**************

These are no longer regularly maintained in Online Updates, but do get updated in new
releases. We are currently running 373 'solid' picons, plus 46 'symlinked' picons
(linking two 'solids' to the regional BBC and ITV names). Total 419 picons, mostly
thanks to the hard work and sharing by humforce, LraiZer, and Ronan Collins.

And (thanks to Abu Baniaz) we now have our proper ITV regional channel names back! it
is amazing what LraiZer's new AutoBouquets N1 can do, when asked...

Keymapping- R/C Volume Keys
***************************

Most clone DM500 remotes seem to use the < / > arrow keys either side of the 0 key for 
Volume Up/Dn functions, not the < / > keys by the OK button (which are actually marked 
as Vol- and Vol+).

This doesn't bother most users, who in any case prefer to leave the dm500 at 100% 
volume and to use the TV R/C for Volume and Mute control. 

However, to satisfy the users who insist on remapping the Volume keys on the remote, 
Satsearching tweaked the Settings > Keybinding Menu code to add the facility to remap 
the Volume Keys. It's a bit tedious changing these settings in the Keymapping Menu,
so we've come up with a new script in Utilities menu that does this for you 'on the
fly' in seconds! The script is 'hot-swapping' to enable the volume keys to be put
back to our default positions. Utilities: BLUE > BLUE > YELLOW and then YELLOW for
the Volume Control menu, and RED to swap the Volume keys. Not as bad as it sounds!

Note that when the volume keys are remapped to be adjacent to the OK key, Virtual Zap
still works. First bring up the Infobar with the Info or Help button, then use the
Vol- and Vol+ keys to virtual zap back and forward. Press OK to zap or Exit to quit.

LATE BREAKING NEWS
==================

Some users like to include an 'all channels' bouquet in their Bouquets line-up, and
there have been numerouus requests to have this in A-Z order. LraiZer to the rescue!

FIRST TIME USEAGE: (NOT for DM500C cable, note!!!)
Go into the Scan menu and press the YELLOW key once, to change the default mode from
Bouquet > update to Bouquet > Satellite Bouquet (There is no need to SAVE settings)

Press BLUE to start the Scan. It takes about five minutes, and after, you'll have a
new bouquet named 'Astra 28.2E' appended to the existing bouquets, with all it's 
entries sorted into A-Z order, making it much easier to navigate to what you want to
find than before, with the old random BskyB ordering. 

FOLLOW-ON USEAGE:
IMPORTANT! When doing subsequent scans with this mode, you must first DELETE the
existing Astra 28.2E bouquet in Bouquet Editor (and SAVE). If you don't, then only 
CHANGES will be applied and it won't get A-Z sorted properly.

NEW in Commando 15.0 is that AutoBouquets now detects the presence of your Astra A-Z
bouquet and saves it! When AutoBouquets has finished, it patches your A-Z bouquet 
back onto the end of your newly-created autobouquets! How cool is that? Previously,
AutoBouquets simply nuked this bouquet, but not any longer).

PLEASE BE AWARE that if you have AutoBouquets 'Parental Control' set to 'ON' then the
Astra A-Z bouquet generated by this scan may initially contain adult services... In
theory, a subsequent run of AutoBouquets (in Parental Control mode) should then block
the adult content appearing onscreen, as they will not exist in the newly-created 
services.xml file. Feedback on this theory would be appreciated, please.

The online download option for an A-Z Astra bouquet has been dropped for C15.0 and 
updating it for users still on C14.7 has now ceased as of the last version on our
servers dated 27 Jan 2014. 

==================================================
NEW in the C15.0b update on 14 Feb 2014 - PASSWORD

On the contentious C15.0 password front, Lincsat came up with a cool idea, and 
Lraizer has helped us hard-code it deep inside the heart of the neutrino binary.
The passwd file is now back in /var/etc and is still 'unpassworded' by default.
If a user sets a password for user root via the Telnet passwd command, but then
afterwards forgets what it is (for Telnet / FTP / remote access), they now have
a new 'Settings' menu option: "Reset root password". This returns to the C15.0b
'no password' default instantly, to win back your Telnet and FTP access!
