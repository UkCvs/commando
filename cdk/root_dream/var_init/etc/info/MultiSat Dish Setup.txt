DiSEQc DISH SETTINGS IN COMMANDO 15.0d - 27 October 2014
________________________________________________________

Section 1: DiSEQc 1.2 Motorized dish setup
Initial settings via the menus GUI
==================================

main menu > service > service scan > diseqc = diseqc 1.2
motor settings > use gotoxx = on
enter your current location
 
if not using gotoxx then you need to set the stored positions on your 
motor against the sat list in the motor settings menu.
 
e.g.
if Astra 28.2E is stored in position 1 on your motor then set 
Astra 28.2 = 1
if Thor 2/3 0.8W is stored in position 8 on your motor then set 
Thor 2/3 0.8W = 8

Another setup method using FTP remotely
=======================================

ftp download /var/tuxbox/config/scan.conf
 
if using usals/gotoxx edit these settings in scan.conf using a unix compatible
editor (like freeware notepad++), adding your dish lat-long:
 
diseqcMode=5
gotoXXLatitude=51.48738
gotoXXLongitude=0.327157
useGotoXX=1
 
OR
 
if using stored sat positions in the motor instead of usals/gotoxx just edit:
diseqcMode=5
 
then as an example look for SatName[] for Astra 28.2E, this is currently
SatName20 insert the relevant position stored on motor for this sat eg.
satMotorPos20=3
 
ftp edited scan.conf back to box and reboot your box

Finally, for users who aren't 100% sure where they live:
=======================================================

Let's try just using the usals ONLY option to start with. First set DiSEqc= 1.2 
then turn OFF all the sat lists changed in both lists so we know we are starting 
clean. If your motor has been setup correctly then this is your easiest option.
 
goto "google maps" in your web browser, zoom into your house where your dish is 
mounted. Right-click on your dish postition and select "Whats Here?" Now hover 
over the new green arrow and make a note of the lat/long position. Ignore any 
minus sign in longitude. Enter these latitude longitude co-ordinates in the 
gotoxx settings and turn gotoxx=on.
 
scanning and zapping should now auto move to correct satellite  location without 
needing to enter any other settings.

Abu Banaiz has written a superb illustrated user-guide in pdf format covering
this subject. You can dowmload using this link:

Thanks for taking the time to do that, Abu, and for sharing your work! Also, one
our beta testers <doink 1955> gave this excellent feedback:

O.k. Heres the techy stuff. Popped image on as is from the mothership link. No 
messing with anything in the utillities menu. 
menu>services>scan>bouquets mode: add satellite bouquet.
Dish setup: Diseqc 1.0
Diseqc settings: 28.2 = 1, 19.2 = 2, 13.0 = 4
>Back>save settings.
Reboot box for settings to take affect.

After reboot back to Menu>scan mode>one sat>astra 19.2E>back>start scan.
Heres where the weird thing starts. It doesn't scan one sat, it scans all sats. At
completion the new sats are not in the bouquet menu. I then repeated this but
after selecting one sat, i then saved that setting. Previously this was not required.

Start scan. Once again it scannes all sats not just the one. But this time after
completion, the satellite bouquets are now in the bouquet menu. I then decided
to check and make sure that AB's would not break these. So in service menu
changed bouquets mode back to "do not modify". Then blue button>AB's now.

50 seconds later AB's complete. O.K.>menu. All bouquets intact including  the
euro ones. populated and working.


Sorry if this is a bit drawn out mate, but am trying to be as cocise as possible as
to the results and how i arrived at them.
