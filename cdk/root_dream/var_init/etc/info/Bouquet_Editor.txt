Bouquets Editor - Commando 15.0c - 30 April 2014
================================================

Since LraiZer's 28.2E AutoBouquets inception for Commando DM500, we've screamed
at you NOT to use Bouquet Editor, as any changes saved in there would only be
undone the next time AutoBouquets is run. A shame to be unable to use such a
useful neutrino GUI and yWeb resource, when Bouquet Editor is so user-friendly
and fast and intuitive to use...

Well, in the dev stages of C15.0c release and online update, we had a rather
radical thought: "Who wags the dog's tail? The dog, or it's master?". So we took
a totally different approach for Autobouquets scripting, starting afresh from a
blank sheet of paper (and continual step by step testing)

From C15.0c onwards, you structure your Bouquets names and ordering, Bouquets
Hide/Show, Bouquets Lock/Unlock, Channels Add / Remove / Ordering within bouquets
ALL with Bouquet Editor, either the MENU > Services OSD version with your remote,
and/or the yWeb Bouquet Editor interface from your PC, which some consider easier.

WHY? Well, when you launch the OSD Bouquet Editor, you'll see your full bouquet
list, even the empty ones (that don't show in zapit). At the bottom is this:

[red] Delete [green] Add [yellow] Move [blue] [M] Rename

It's that last [blue] button function that is NOT intuitive, sadly. Press the [MENU]
button once, and the 'Rename' caption toggles to 'Hide'. Press [MENU] again and 'Hide'
toggles to 'Lock'. Press [MENU] again, and you've gone full circle back to 'Rename'!
So pressing [blue] will action whichever one of the three captions is showing.

Play with it, it's easy once you get the hang of it, honest! The 'Hide' and 'Lock'
functions simply toggle the status of these switches for the highlighted bouquet from
Show to Hide, and/or Lock to Unlock. The icons on the left make it crystal clear!

Please note that if you are running a "My Favourites" bouquet, that this name is
FIXED by the zapit binary. Do NOT try and rename it, please!!!

Ensure you SAVE any changes in Bouquet Editor when you exit! Changes will be instant
on your tv in the current session, like always. But now, more importantly, we've made
AutoBouquets OBEY these changes (rather than blitz them) when it next runs, by making
a brand new custom_sort_x.txt from the saved bouquets.xml in order for it to build a
new one! Now the dog is wagging it's tail, and Autobouquets is slave, not master! No
more manual editing of custom_sort or bouquet list files, finally!

It's why TC code-named this project 'Mission Impossible' during C15.0c dev. Coz some
devs said it WAS impossible. Thinking 'outside of the box' hopefully did the trick...
