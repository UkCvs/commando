# Commando 16 for DM500C - 10-16 Jan 2017 (thanks deejay and Abu Baniaz!)
# Set My Location for FastScan helpfile assistant

# STOP PRESS! Sun 15 Jan 2017, LraiZer committed Set My Location to the C16 build!
Then a few days later (fed up with being nagged) he added Parental Control for Scan!

Go into the Scan Menu (MENU > Services > Green)
Arrow down to hilite '1 Scan-Modes' and click OK
Here, you'll find the new Parental Control feature, which is ON by default, meaning
NO "Adult" bouquet and NO adult content in services after a Scan! Squeaky-clean! If
you require adult, just toggle this item to OFF (but it'll make you go blind...)

Now select 'Region' and find and hilite YOUR local VM cable headend. Press OK to
select. Back out with the left key and press RED to SAVE, then BLUE to Scan!

Still no idea of your REGION?:
---------------------------
Go into your VM rental box "Techy stuff" menu and you'll find it in there! If you
are not subbed, then consider yourself naughty and frowned upon... Try a nearby
mate or neighbour who DOES have a subbed box and ask them to help you?

Now on your dm500c box, using C16 from 08 Jan 2017 or later, go into the SCAN
menu and manually enter your 5 digit NetID, your 6 digit Frequency, and
then toggle your Symrate to 6875, 6887, or 6952 (there can only be one!). You
do this by highlighting the <Scan-Modes One Transponder> line then click OK
and then enter YOUR local data in the required fields. Then SAVE settings!

Do NOT change anything else! Just press BLUE to scan. In 3-4 mins, you
should finish and when you Exit, you will now have an excellent set of VM
local bouquets, thanks to LraiZer, (plus the new Scan start/end scripts that
were committed to the C16 GitHub build on 22 Jan 2017)! If the Scan ends after
a few seconds with "No Channels Found!", it means the wrong SML details were
entered. The system will recover to it's pre-Scan state (NEW feature!)

If the Scan is halfway through and you can see zilch TV and Radio services
being picked up, just press the [EXIT] key to cancel the Scan, lick your
wounds, make a cuppa, and ponder where you've gone wrong... Again, it's
wrong SML details the likely culprit! Try another nearby location???

### STILL no idea of your NetID? Don't despair! ###
===================================================
C16 now has the 'NitScan' Plugin on the BLUE button! It only takes 30 secs
and will create a new cables.xml scanfile for YOUR locality. It does an auto
reboot after (to read the new settings into memory), but that's no big deal
if you have no telly to start with, LOL!

# after restart, try <Scan-Modes Complete> (once known as UK BruteForce)

Thanks to LraiZer's recent C16 dev, you'll now see a decent set of bouquets!
Then it's time to get to work with a 30min tidy up, LOL! Mainly with the 1-5
regional channels... Do this in MENU > Services> Bouquet Editor (pleeZe)

Click on "Entertainment" and you'll see lots of "BBC One" channels, yeah?
Okay, CAREFULLY highlight each one (starting from the top and working down)
and press [OK] to zap to it. If you see a black background and hear no audio
then it's NOT for your region! Press RED to DELETE it!

When you DO get a picture and sound, BINGO! That's your local BBC One taken
care of, woooo! So bypass that one (KEEP it, by NOT deleting it) and move on
through the rest. There's usually another working BBC One for an adjacent
area that works as well. Keep it for now, as you can later move that one to
another bouquet...

Now repeat this exercise for the vanilla-named "ITV" channels. Same applies
as above. You might get one or two working ones?

Then find your working "ITV +1", "Channel 4" and "Channel 5" regionals and
nuke the non-working ones!

SAVE whenever prompted, if you're happy with your edits to Bouquets!!!

You should now have a good set of Bouquets on which to tinker with further.
Remember! BACK UP your new /var/tuxbox/zapit/bouquets.xml file from DM500C
to a safe place on your PC via FTP using a folder or filename that you'll
recogniZe later, pleaZe! As a subsequent Scan will OVERWRITE it on your
DM500C box... You've been warned!

With a tested and working backup, you can easily recover, if necessary!

All good fun... ;)
