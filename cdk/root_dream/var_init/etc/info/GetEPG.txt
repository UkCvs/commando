GetEPG by LraiZer - for Commando 15.0 - 29 Jan 2014
===========================================================

WHAT IS IT? 
Up to 7 Days EPG direct from the Astra 28.2E sat stream, so it works even if your 
box isn't online. This stays the default EPG mode, as it looks like the future for 
RadioTimes online EPG still remains in doubt, sadly...

You can easily change the EPG source to RT-EPG with a BLUE > BLUE > RED > GREEN 
key press sequence.  GetEPG is fully-compatible (according to LraiZer) with the 
DreamboxUK Database and the SgtFlipFlop services, if you first load them and then 
carry out an Update Scan. But to be frank, LraiZer's latest AutoBouquets feature 
blows the other services and bouquets providers clear out of the water, in terms 
of speed and guaranteed up to date accuracy!  No offence intended...

GetEPG Plugin
=============
The GetEPG Plugin is on BLUE > 3 which means you can now execute a manual EPG 
load with just two key presses! Do this during the Ads break though, as it does take 
about 3 minutes.  During loading, your box is actually in Radio Mode, with a splash 
screen and 10 sec popup progress  messages. When loading is complete, it zaps back 
to the original channel you were viewing, after popping up a summary detailing the
number of Events stored, memory useage, and so on. (See also /var/log for info)

Another benefit of having the GetEPG Plugin is that it opens up the possibility of
loading GetEPG on a Daily Timer at a time to suit you. Of course, the other options 
of having GetEPG automatically load 60 seconds after a reboot and/or after the box 
wakes up from Standby are still available in the menu, but these are switched off by 
default. Both these options (Reboot / Standby) can also be set as Daily Timers, too.

See the Q&A section of the AutoBouquets doc for specific help and advice on this, as
it is possible now to do the whole lot with just ONE AutoBouquets daily timer! :)

GetEPG User Customization
=========================

GetEPG is highly (and very easily) customizeable in terms of the number of days EPG
(0 to 7) for individual channels, number of hours for Long Descriptions, etc. 

As always- please heed this advice: Use Notepad++ (Freeware) for editing and NOT your
FTP internal editor, nor Windoze notepad /wordpad. You have been warned!  Your target 
file for editing is NEW: /var/etc/custom_epg.txt and the syntax of this is simple:

#####################################################
#													#
#	AutoBouquets N1 - custom channel epg manager	#
#	Welcome to your user-friendly custom_epg.txt	#
#		(for GetEPG and NOT RT-EPG please note)		#
#													#
#####################################################
#													#
#	KEYCODE											#
#	1:2:3:4:5										#
#													#
#	1=[101-999]	sky ch no. (required- do not edit!)	#
#	2=[0/1]		ch epg off/on (required- toggle)	#
#	3=[0-7]		ch epg days (required- editable)	#
#	4=[0 or 18]	epg desc hours (required- toggle*)	#
#	5=[Ch Name]	Optional (but now 100% automatic)	#
#													#
#	* HOT TIP: to save memory, make 4=0 hrs for +1	#
#	and crap channels, or 18 hrs for premium stuff	#
#####################################################

Sorry that tab format doesn't work in the TuxCom OSD, making it look a bit ragged...

OK, the second field is 1 = EPG ON or 0 = EPG OFF. Easy one this. ON for prime channels, 
but OFF for the naff ones, like those in News, Shopping, etc. Why waste memory?

The third field lets you set the number of days (0 to 7) that you want EPG for.
Be sensible, and break it down into nice chunks. For example, 7 days for prime Movies 
and Sport, 4 days on quality Entertainment, Factual etc. 2 days for Kids and Music. 1 day 
for reasonable channels you seldom watch, and 0 days for the rubbish stuff, of course.

The fourth field is the number of hours you want Long Descriptions for. 18 hours is a
an optimal setting for the 'good' channels, as this means that if you load GetEPG at 6am
daily, you'll have Long Descriptions through to midnight. 0 hours for rubbish channels!

Unlike C14.7 where a syntax-perfect channel name was required in the usermap, LraiZer's
new scheme doesn't even need a channel name. So when editing custom_epg.txt it is a
good idea to cross-refer to the latest /var/etc/channels.cfg file (automatically created
by the last run of AutoBouquets) in order to relate channel number to channel name.

Please BE SURE not to accidentally delete any the ':' column markers when editing! And
that's it! When you next run the fantastic new AutoBouquets that LraiZer has created for
us, your brand-new and bang-up-to-date GetEPG mapfile is automatically created, ready
for you to load GetEPG!

Enjoy!

=====================================================================================

UPDATE: Not only are all the channel names now included in custom_epg.txt - but these
are automatically system-maintained, too! (If AutoBouquets detected any changes, it also
creates a NEW custom_epg.txt usermap file in the background for you, with the changed
channel names, in under 15 secs!)

AutoBouquets uses your custom_epg.txt file to write its new channels.cfg file, which is
the file that GetEPG reads. Much more user-friendly, and no longer any need to x-ref with
another file like before! For C15.1c 25 Nov 2015 onwards

=================================================================================

LATEST UPDATE for Commando 15.1f release late June, 2016

With RT-EPG nuked from the BBC server as of 17 June 2016 - TC have spent a fortnight of
daily optimizing and testing to provide C15.1f 28.2E users with a much faster and more
efficient makeover of the default GetEPG settings, to get them going again afresh!

We now map 295 channels, with SM and SS1 set at 1:7:18 (12 channels- 7 Days)
180 channels are set at 1:0:18 (now until midnight same day with full summaries)
103 channels are set at 1:0:00 (now until midnight same day with no summaries)

This takes less than two minutes to load, and if set for the new cronjob daily load, it
will do you proud. Maximum memory usage with this map if loaded at 06:15 will be around
5MB, well within your DM500S stability zone.

For the night owls who need EPG from midnight thru to brekky time, simply edit your
/var/etc/custom_epg.txt usermap file with the FREEWARE Notepad++ linux-friendly Editor
and in the channels you like to watch at silly o'clock, change instances of:

xxx:1:0:yy:chname
to
xxx:1:1:24:chname

on the channels you need overnight epg for. Dead simple, and it will give you nocturnal
peeps full 24 hour EPG Events coverage for your preferred wee hours channels from the
time that GetEPG last ran! Please be sensible and balance things out, by switching an
equal number of channels that you NEVER watch to NO epg, by changing:

xxx:1:0:18:chname
to
xxx:0:0:00:chname

Have fun! TC - 24 June 2016 ;)
