Recording to a mounted network drive with C15.0 Jan 2014
========================================================
Here's an excellent tutorial written by mickb82 over on www.digital-kaos.co.uk/forums

Its pretty easy to setup recording on Commando 15.0 But before you start you will need 
to setup and get some information from your PC.

Firstly you need to decide what drive you want to use for your recordings, I use a 32gb
USB stick plugged driectly into my router but you can also use a shared network drive 
on your PC. Note down the following link for advice on setting up sharing on your PC: 

+++ http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Share-files-with-someone +++

Also to make sure that commando re-connects to your shared drive automatically it would
be best to assign your PC a static IP address. This is not needed if your using a USB 
plugged into your router like I am as this uses your router IP address. You will need 
to consult your router instructions or google to find out how to do this.

Before you set things up on commando you need the following information:

1. Your PC or router IP address. (On windows 7 open network & sharing centre, click on
 change adaptor settings and double click on your network connection. Then click details
 and the PC IP address is shown as IPv4 Address and your router IP Address is shown as 
 IPv4 Default gateway)

2. Your PC or router MAC address. (On windows 7 open network & sharing centre, click on 
 change adaptor settings and double click on your network connection. Then click details 
 and the MAC address is shown as physical address. To get your router MAC address you 
 would need to login to your router)
 
(In XP: open a DOS command console with Start > Run > command <enter> and type in:
 ipconfig -all 
and you will see the IP and MAC addresses for your PC)

3. The exact name you have chosen for your shared folder or drive.

4. The login information for your router (usually username:admin password:admin)

Right now to set things up on Commando!

Firstly go into settings/network and press blue (mount edit network shares) then press 
red to mount a network volume.

Select the first slot and you will have a list of items that you need to enter 
information into:
Type: CIFS
Server IP: (Your router or PC IP address)
Directory/Share: (The exact name of your shared folder or drive)
Local Directory: (I chose mmt/cf)
Mount On Startup: Yes
Mount Options: Change the ro to rw
Mount Options: Leave this as it is
Username: (Your router username. I didnt have a PC username so I used my router one 
and it worked)
Password: (Your router password. I didnt have a PC password so I used my router one 
and it worked)
MAC Address: Enter your PC or Router MAC Address
Mount Now: Press OK

To make sure it has been mounted, press green to unmount your network volume (but 
don't actually unmount it). If its been setup correctly it should be listed in the 
unmount menu. Now exit back to settings.

Next select recording in settings, then change the recording device to direct (file)
then press green to enter direct recording settings. I used the following settings:

Recording directory: (same name used earlier when setting up the network drive)
Choose directory on recording: off
Directory Permissions: 755
Ringbuffer Size: 8MB
Maximum File Size: (This depends on how your drive is formatted as to what the maximum
filesize can be, I use 2048mb)
Write Sync (O_SYNC): off
Write Sync (fdatasync): off
Record VideoText: off
Record Subtitles: off

I have set long filenames on and the filenmame template to %T_%d but you can set this 
up however you want.

Once all the settings are entered exit and press red to activate changes.

Recording is now set up!!!

To record the channel you are watching press blue and press red to start recording then
press red to stop the recording. (Works in Commando 14.7 so should it in C15.0)

To schedule a recording you can either manually enter the times and channels by 
pressing blue, then yellow then green and entering all the details or you can navigate 
the epg to find the program you want to record then press info and press red to schedule
a record. (I can't get recordings done by this method to playback on C14.7 due to it
somehow defaulting to NAR audio rather than English, but this method works fine on the 
old C14.3 image. Team Commando are investigating this issue at the time of writing).

To playback a recording press blue then green then navigate to the folder you chose 
earlier (mnt/cf)

I have set mine up using all the above information and I have Timer recording working 
perfectly on C14.3!

14 March 2013 Update:

Our new combination of Audio-Priority with FastZap now set to ON not only results
in perfect lip syncronization in AV, not to mention even faster channel zapping
than before- testing shows that TS Recordings now play back perfectly, too! Now 
THAT'S what we call a 'three for the price of one' bargain! Happy days! :)

29 January 2014: All carried over to Commando 15.0 so no reason for it not to work!
