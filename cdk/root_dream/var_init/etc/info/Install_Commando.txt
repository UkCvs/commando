Welcome to C16 test image! On first boot, it will then tell you that it's loading
the default neutrino settings. This message will not appear on subsequent starts.

Install method 1:
=================
As suggested by LraiZer, and tests out perfectly, thanks! After flashing the
latest C16 snapshot test image, just download the C16-public-shell_adds.tar.gz
tarball to your PC.

Then go into the yWeb I/F and click the Tools tab, then yInstaller
Browse to the tarball on your PC, then click the 'Upload/Install' button.
After about 30secs, you'll see a "job done" message!
But please READ further down as regards your next sequential steps!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install method 2 (for the FTP/Telnet aficionados):
==================================================

Use WinRAR to extract the install.sh script from the tarball
FTP that and the C16-public-shell_adds.tar.gz tarball to /tmp

Telnet:
==============

login: root <enter>

~ > cd tmp <enter>

/tmp > chmod 755 install.sh <enter>

/tmp > tar -xzf C16-public-shell_adds.tar.gz <enter>

/tmp > ./install.sh <enter>

Update done! Now exit Telnet
===================================

NEXT- FOR WHICHEVER INSTALL METHOD:
-----------------------------------
If you're NOT in London, go BLUE > BLUE > RED to SML and set your location.

Default +1 sorting is 'with parent channel'. Change this to '+1 bouquet' or
'stream order' (if desired) in BLUE > BLUE > GREEN > GREEN > YELLOW menu.

If you want Parental Control OFF (Adult ON- and not worried about going blind):
From TV: BLUE > BLUE > GREEN > GREEN > GREEN > RED > RED
While in that menu, PLEASE read and understand the help lines!!

## It no londger matters one iota in which order you carry out the above ##
Come out of that lot back to plain TV

#### NOW run AutoBouquets from BLUE > 2 (and THEN GetEPG) ####

ONCE you have followed this initial setup sequence correctly, THEN you can go and
mess inside MENU > Services > RED for Bouquets Editor and rearrange things to how
you want them (not forgetting to SAVE on exit!) ABs 'should' recogniZe your new
Bouquets layout the very next time you run it, and thereafter!

Follow these destructions precisely and it's happy days!
Go against the grain and mess around in Bouquet Editor first- BAD NEWS!!!

Oh, before scanning for other Sats, first reboot to read in the new satellites.xml

# AN <IMPORTANT> FOOTNOTE CONCERNING MOUNTING TO AN EXTERNAL HDD OR USB!!! #
============================================================================
If you intend to use an external MOUNT drive, then PLEASE use the ultra-safe /mount
folder (yes- in the read-only root partitition!) as your local dm500 mount point to
your shared (fast) hdd mount, or (slow) usb router stick!

NEVER use the R/W /var folder as a mount point, please! This can be catastrophic if
your mount isn't actually mounted, and will likely cause your dm500 to crash, BIG
time, as a result of incorrectly writing shedloads of data to /var flash memory!!!

Once mounted successfully, you can then access that /mount folder (via your dm500
and FTP) as an 'active' R/W folder! Create new sub folders under the /mount folder
like /epg and /movies and so on, as many as you need!

In this way, you only need one mount PER external device. This advice is based on
VITAL test feedback from LraiZer, TC and daverave! Ignore it at your peril...

HAVE FUN!
