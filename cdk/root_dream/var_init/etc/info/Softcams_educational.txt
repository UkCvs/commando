Softcams:

Must be in the /var/bin/emu/ folder (don't worry about chmod stuff)

For DM500C(or)S boxes, google or bling search your choice of the following
recommended binaries for C15:

CCcam 2.2.1 (do NOT go later than this!)
mgcamd 1.35a
oscam 1.20 powerpc-tuxbox-old

In each case, you should find a rar or a zip download for different types
of box architecture. You want the PPC version, OK? Download to PC

Unzip / Unrar your download and save 'as' the relevant one of the following:

CCcam
mgcamd
oscam

This is Linux/Unix, so filenames are cAse sEnsiTive remember! Copy your
softcam binary to the target folder indicated above, using your favourite
FTP program.

Config files for the above softcams go in following locations:

/var/etc/CCcam.cfg 
/var/keys/mg_cfg (AND with cccam.list and/or newcamd.list as appropriate) 
/var/tuxbox/config/oscam.* (4 files)

You need to tinker with the related cfg file(s) to do your tests! Use
notepad++ text Editor for this, as it is Linux friendly! (and FREEWARE!)

You will need to start the cam after transferring and configuring

BLUE > MENU > RED
(Blue > Extras menu > Softcam Menu)  
Select the Cam and start it

Happy testing and learning! After that, please revert to FTA and be safe..
